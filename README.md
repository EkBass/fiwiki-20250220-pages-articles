# Finnish Wikipedia articles 20.02.2025 as json dataset

On the way to my first small cognitive intelligence model, the very first thing I had to do was somehow parse the entire Finnish Wikipedia in a sensible way.

I think the end result is already quite good.

There are some inaccuracies in the data, but 95% of it is already in very good Finnish and structurally sound.

This is not enough, but I now want to publish both the dataset and the instructions for creating it in case someone else is interested in a similar project.

1. Download latest Wikipedia dump file from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/fiwiki/
2. Extract the download, you get XML file.
3.
